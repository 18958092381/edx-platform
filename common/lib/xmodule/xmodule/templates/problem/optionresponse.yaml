        "Translation between Dropdown and __________ is extremely straightforward:
        
        [[(Multiple Choice), Text Input, Numerical Input, Image Mapped Input]]

        [explanation]
        Multiple Choice also allows students to select from a variety of pre-written responses, although the 
        format makes it easier for students to read very long response options. Dropdown also differs 
        slightly because students are more likely to think of an answer and then search for it rather than 
        relying purely on recognition to answer the question.
